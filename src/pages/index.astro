        <p>
          As a highly experienced senior software engineer and technical leader,
          I've dedicated my career to creating exceptional digital experiences
          for clients ranging from startups to established businesses. My
          expertise lies in full-stack web development and commercial
          application creation, with a focus on building scalable, secure, and
          performant solutions that meet the needs of modern businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional work, I'm deeply committed to open
          source projects and mentoring beginner programmers. As a former
          instructor at <Link

            target="_blank"
          >
            The Electric Hive
          </Link> (a hacker and programmer collective dedicated to mentoring) I
          led a team of developers in creating innovative solutions and provided
          mentorship and guidance to up-and-coming programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my years of experience, I've gained a deep understanding of
          the latest technologies and trends in the industry, always eager to
          discover and learn new ways to improve my craft. If you're looking for
          a seasoned technical leader who strives for excellence, look no
          further than me.

        <Heading id="work">Work & projects</Heading>
        <p>
          For the past couple of years, I've been working really close to known
          companies from around the world, doing web consulting & project
          assessments, or just belonging to an awesome team of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some of the most remarkable projects I've had the fortune to
          develop (or contribute to) and see in action:
        </p>
        {work.map((work) => <Work {...work} />)}
        <p>

          Open source & side projects are important too. I've spent a major part
          of the past couple years working on web development, ai-related stuff
          & small interesting projects. Some of them are:
        </p>
        <div class="projects-grid">
          {projects.map((project) => <Project {...project} />)}
        </div>

          I've played with the idea of starting to write my thoughts and
          experiences in some sort of blog, this is where I'll compile most of
          the important things I've learned and experienced during my whole
          coding journey. Feel free to look around!
